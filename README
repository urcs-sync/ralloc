Notes
---
	- We have tried to faithfully implement Michael's allocator as he 
	  described it in his PLDI 2004 paper. However, our implementation has 
	  no page manager and performs no superblock caching. Our experiments 
	  show that these two features will significantly impact performance on
	  some applications.
